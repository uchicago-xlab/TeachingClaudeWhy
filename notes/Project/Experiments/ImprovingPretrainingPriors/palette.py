"""Colour palette for every figure in the report (2026-09-15).

Two anchors are the labs' brand colours, softened so they sit on a page
without shouting; every other categorical colour is chosen to be a distinct
hue from those two at the same muted saturation and mid lightness, so a
figure that mixes lab colours with generic series still reads as one family.
Baselines and reference lines are grey. Paired conditions on the same
series (embodiment vs recitation, or any "full vs control") use the colour
and its TINT rather than a second hue.
