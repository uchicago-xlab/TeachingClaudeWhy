"""Single source of truth for chat format: messages -> tokens, both directions.

The arbiter is each model's own HF chat template (apply_chat_template with the
family's thinking-off kwargs). Training and eval both come through here, so
the thinking shape trained into a checkpoint and the shape primed at sampling
time cannot drift apart — test_render.py and check_render.py enforce it.

Mechanism for the training span: render the conversation twice —
  prompt = template(messages[:-1], add_generation_prompt=True, **kwargs)
  full   = template(messages,      add_generation_prompt=False, **kwargs)
and require `full` to start with `prompt`; the completion is the remainder.
Templates that prime generation-only text the full render omits break that
prefix property; the family's assistant_prefix declares that text, and we
rebuild
  full = prompt + encode(assistant_prefix + content) + turn_suffix
where turn_suffix is derived mechanically (see _derive_suffix). check_render.py
(Task 6) is what discovers, per family, whether assistant_prefix is needed.

A second, opposite knob is generation_prefill: text the template *does* emit at
the start of the assistant turn, which we additionally prime at sampling time
so the model continues from it instead of choosing what to open its turn with.
Inkling needs it — its generation prompt stops at `<|message_model|>`, leaving
the model to pick the block type, and effort "none" does not stop it picking
`<|content_thinking|>`. Priming `<|content_text|>` forces the first block to be
the answer. The prefill lands in the *prompt* span both at eval and in
training, so training weights start after it; render_training_example refuses
(RenderMismatch) if the template's own render does not begin the completion
with those exact tokens, since a prefill that does not match template emission
would train a span that is primed at eval — the misalignment this file exists
to prevent.

No sweep family needs assistant_prefix so far. Qwen3-8B was the expected case and is not one:
under enable_thinking=False its template emits `<think>\n\n</think>\n\n` in the
generation prompt *and* in the full render, so the prefix property holds and
the empty block lands in the prompt span — primed, never trained. That block is
unconditional in the full render (it appears under enable_thinking=True too),
so a full render alone cannot distinguish thinking-off from thinking-on for
Qwen3; only the generation prompt can, which is what
test_thinking_kwargs_actually_reach_the_template asserts on.
