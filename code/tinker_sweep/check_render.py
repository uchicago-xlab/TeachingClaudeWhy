"""Verify every sweep model's render path and dump inspectable samples.

For each model: load its tokenizer, render one real adapted training example
and its generation prompt, run the prefix-consistency check, compare the
thinking-off prompt against the thinking-on one, count think markers, derive
stop strings, and write a human-readable dump to
data/tinker-sweep/render-samples/<slug>.txt. Exits non-zero if any model fails.

    ../../.venv-tinker/bin/python check_render.py                 # all models
    ../../.venv-tinker/bin/python check_render.py --model Qwen/Qwen3-8B

The dumps are NOT committed (data/ is gitignored); they are the artifact you
read before trusting a family, and they regenerate in a couple of minutes.

Why the thinking on/off prompt comparison exists: for Qwen3 (and 3.5/3.6) the
*full* render is byte-identical with thinking on and off — the empty think
block is emitted either way — so a prefix-consistency check alone passes even
if the family's thinking kwargs never reached the template. Only the generation
prompt distinguishes the two, so that is what gets compared. A family whose
kwargs leave the prompt unchanged is a silent thinking-ON run, which is the
exact confound this project has been bitten by before.

The comparison is *directional*, not just differential. Two settings rendering
two different prompts says nothing about which of them is the off one: a family
added with its on/off kwargs swapped, or copy-pasted from a neighbour in the
wrong direction, would still differ and still train thinking-ON. So each family
also declares the off_shape its template emits only when thinking is off, and
the check requires that text to be present in the prompt actually used and
absent from the thinking-on one.
