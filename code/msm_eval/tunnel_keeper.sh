# Why this exists rather than a plain `ssh -f -N -L`: a tunnel that dies
# mid-run does NOT surface as an error. Inspect swallows the dropped
# connections as retries with escalating backoff, so a dead tunnel looks
# exactly like a slow model — last time that cost 15 minutes of a paid run
# before anyone noticed. ServerAliveInterval alone did not prevent it.
#
# So this does not trust the ssh process to still be working. It probes the
# forwarded port every 20s with a real HTTP request to /v1/models, and rebuilds
# the tunnel whenever the probe fails. Watch the log, or watch GPU utilization
# on the pod — never "is the ssh process alive", which is the thing that lies.
