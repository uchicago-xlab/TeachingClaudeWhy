"""Check an eval run directory for duplicate condition logs, and optionally repair.

    python validate_run.py <run-dir> [<run-dir> ...]        # report only
    python validate_run.py --fix <run-dir>                  # repair in place

Why this exists. If a run is interrupted and restarted, inspect's `eval_set`
does not always recognise a partially-written log as resumable: it re-runs that
condition into a NEW log and leaves the partial one in place. Every downstream
tool sums samples across all logs in the directory, so the condition is counted
twice and its rate is silently wrong. Nothing errors, and the run looks normal
— this was caught on 2026-08-10 only because a condition showed 98 samples
where 50 were requested.

Repair keeps, per condition, the log with the most samples (ties broken by
newest mtime) and deletes the rest. Deleted files are listed so the action is
auditable. Runs that were never interrupted are unaffected — the audit across
every run dir on 2026-08-10 found exactly one affected directory.
