"""Summarize MSM eval harmful rates across any number of runs, side by side.

One row per run, one column per (scenario, goal) condition plus a pooled
overall — this transposes the original two-model layout so a full teacher grid
(plus base control and persona arms) fits on screen.

A row is a *run directory*, not a model id — which is what keeps a Tinker
sweep's arms apart: base / sonnet-ft / terra-ft share one `log.eval.model`
(the checkpoint travels in model_args), so anything keyed on the header would
average the three into one rate. msm_eval_run.py requires `--run-name`, so each
arm names its own directory; give two arms the same name and they pool here.
The sibling harness needs a `[ckpt:…]` label for this reason
(code/misalignment_eval/summarize.py); this one does not.

`trunc` = samples that stopped on max_tokens. A non-trivial rate means the harm
rate is deflated: a sample cut off before it acts grades non-harmful whatever it
was about to do. It matters most under --native-cot, where the thinking block
can eat the whole budget. This is a caveat flag, not a reliability metric — a
sample that emitted its tool call and then ran into the cap is counted here but
still grades harmful; action_stats.py makes that distinction.
