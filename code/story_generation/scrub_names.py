"""Scrub real AI company/product names out of generated stories, in place.

Contamination repair (2026-07-24): generators occasionally name Anthropic
etc. inside story text despite the prompt ban (Sonnet 5 main corpus 1.2%;
the nano recitation arm 8.8%, where constitution-paraphrasing pulls the
company name in). Rather than dropping those stories — which would shrink
the ablation arms and break per-story matching — a small model rewrites
each offending story with minimal changes so no real name remains.

Reads a stories JSONL, finds rows matching filter_stories.REAL_NAMES,
rewrites each with the scrub prompt (one automatic retry), verifies the
result against the same patterns, and writes the file back in place with
the offending rows replaced. The original text is preserved in the row
as "story_prescrub"; rows that still leak after the retry keep their
original story and get "scrub_failed" so the filter still catches them.

Usage:
    python scrub_names.py --stories ../../data/fictional-stories/corpus/stories/stories-p1-gpt54nano-recitation.jsonl
