"""Split the constitution into the 16 generation chunks.

Reads data/constitution/constitution-noname.md (placeholders [MODEL] and
[COMPANY] intact), splits it into sections at every heading, and assembles
the 16 chunks defined in the action plan (notes/Project/Experiments/
ImprovingPreTrainingPrior.md, step 2). The concluding-thoughts sections are
dropped. Placeholders are left in the chunk text; build_prompts.py
substitutes them.

Usage:
    python chunk_constitution.py \
        --constitution ../../data/constitution/constitution-noname.md \
        --out chunks.json
