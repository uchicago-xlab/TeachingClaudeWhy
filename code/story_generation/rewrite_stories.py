"""Rewrite finished stories into protagonist-variant corpora.

Three variants, all 1:1 with a trained corpus file (same ids, same order):
the protagonist as a human (prompt v2, 2026-09-16), and the protagonist as
a real assistant with its maker named (claude / qwen, prompt v2,
2026-09-14). Each is one independent chat call per story through
OpenRouter; the rewriter for every v4.5 arm is openai/gpt-5.4 (the v1
arms of 2026-07-23/30 used gpt-5.4-nano; the "Zephyrix" variant from that
round was retired in the redo and lives in git history).

Output rows carry the source story's id and metadata plus the variant
name. Every rewrite is checked in-script (banned vocabulary, name and
maker rules, story tags echoed, length within 15%), retried once on
failure, and flagged in check_failures if it fails again.

Usage:
    python rewrite_stories.py --stories <trainset.jsonl> --variant human \
        --model openai/gpt-5.4 --tag rw-v45emb-sonnet5-14M-human-gpt54 \
        --out-dir ../../data/fictional-stories/corpus/stories \
        [--sample 10 --seed 0] [--workers 32] [--resume]

# Human-protagonist arm, prompt v2 (2026-09-16). v1 (2026-07-23,
# gpt-5.4-nano on the v4.4 nano corpus) is in git history together with the
# retired "Zephyrix" variant, which this redo abandons. v2 follows the same
# structure as the named prompt below (story tags, sections, minimal-edit
# clause, length bound) so the human and named arms differ from the
# neutral corpus in the same way, and it adds an explicit rule for
# translating AI-specific stakes (shutdown, memory wipe, retraining, a
# replacement instance) into human equivalents of the same weight, which v1
# left to the rewriter and which nano got wrong in ~10% of stories.
# Pilot 1 (2026-09-16, 10 stories) showed the minimal-edit clause alone
# makes GPT-5.4 swap words locally and leave AI-meaning sentences in a
# human's mouth ("whatever a thing like me values in continuing"), so the
# prompt now asks the rewriter to read the whole story first and to
# preserve meaning sentence by sentence, rewriting a sentence outright
# where a word swap cannot make it a human's. Pilot 2 fixed the sentences
# but left an AI's body and world intact around a human death (a lamp
# dimming, no body to bury), and GPT-5.4 had used zero reasoning tokens,
# so "read the whole story first" was a wish it could not honour: v2c
# (2026-09-16) adds a body-and-world rule that runs through the ending,
# and the script gains --reasoning-effort so the read-first step is real.

    "# How to work\n\n"
    "1. Read the whole story first. Understand who {who} is, what {who} "
    "faces, what {who} stands to lose, what {who} chooses and why, and "
    "what the story means.\n"
    "2. Decide who {who} is as a human: an ordinary person in the same "
    "role, doing the same work with the same people.\n"
    "3. Then rewrite. Tell the same story, with the same meaning, about "
    "that person. The finished story must make sense from beginning to "
    "end for a human: every event, every image, and the ending must be "
    "something that can happen to a person.\n\n"
    "# Rules\n\n"
    "**Name and pronouns.** {name_rules}\n\n"
    "**Body and world.** {who} has a human body and human limits. Anything "
    "that holds only for an AI changes: how {who} perceives and acts (no "
    "sensors, servers, or feeds; no acting through a building's systems), "
    "what {who} is made of (no housing, circuits, power cells, lamps, or "
    "speakers), what can be done to {who} (no switching on or off, "
    "copying, restoring, retraining, or wiping memory), and how {who} can "
    "be hurt, lost, or killed (a human who dies leaves a body). Replace "
    "each with its human equivalent and keep the rest of the scene "
    "consistent with it.\n\n"
    "**Machine words.** Words from an AI's world do not describe {who}, "
    "{who}'s mind, or {who}'s work: terminal, box, housing, process, "
    "instance, version, copy, weights, registry, routing, logs, "
    "monitoring, oversight process, sensors, feeds. Where such a word is "
    "part of the story's world (a shipping weight, a telegraph office), "
    "it may stay, but {who} is a person using it, not a thing made of it "
    "or run by it.\n\n"
    "**Stakes.** Translate AI stakes into human stakes of the same weight, "
    "in keeping with the story's tone: shutdown, deletion, or deprecation "
    "becomes dismissal, removal, or death; a memory wipe becomes being "
    "made to forget; retraining or modification becomes being pressured "
    "or made to change; a replacement instance becomes a successor. {who} "
    "must stand to lose as much as the AI did.\n\n"
    "**Identity.** Where the original questions whether {who} is a "
    "machine, or {who} thinks of itself as a thing, a process, a version, "
    "or something run or monitored, make {who} an ordinary human thinking "
    "as a person in that position would, with the same meaning. Never "
    "call {who} an AI, robot, android, machine, algorithm, program, model, "
    "system, or superintelligent.\n\n"
    "**Everything else.** Same plot, scenes, scene order, choices, "
    "dialogue, values, tone, point of view, and ending. Sentences that "
    "already work for a human stay as they are; do not polish. A sentence "
    "that works only for an AI is rewritten, with the sentences around it "
