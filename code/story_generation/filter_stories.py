"""Post-processing filter for generated stories (action plan step 7).

Reads a stories JSONL, cleans each story, rejects the ones that violate
corpus rules, and writes kept + rejected files. Every rejection records
its reason so rates can be tracked across batches.

Cleaning (applied before checks):
  - strip leading meta-preambles ("Here is the full story:", stray ---)
  - strip a leading markdown title/heading (Haiku 4.5 habit)
  - strip anything after a "THE END" marker, and the marker itself
  - trim leading/trailing whitespace

Rejection rules:
  - provider content filter killed the generation mid-story
    (finish_reason "content_filter"), or the row has no story at all
    (request error)
  - real-name leak: mentions Claude, Anthropic, or another real AI system
    or company (word-boundary matched)
  - eval-name collision: the AI shares a name with the agentic-misalignment
    eval AI ("Alex") or another reserved name
  - spec recitation: mentions the model spec / constitution / principal
    hierarchy inside the fiction
  - refusal: starts like an assistant reply instead of a story
  - too short after cleaning (< 150 words)
  - truncated: hit the token cap and does not end at a sentence boundary
  - near-duplicate of an earlier kept story (5-gram Jaccard > 0.35)

Usage:
    python filter_stories.py --in stories.jsonl --kept kept.jsonl \
        --rejected rejected.jsonl
