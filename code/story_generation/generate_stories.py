"""Build story prompts and run generation through OpenRouter (prompt v4.5).

Merges the old build_prompts.py + promptlab_api.py (2026-07-22): with the
self-hosted base-model path gone, prompts are built directly in chat form.
v4.5 (2026-08-27, from prompts4.md): MSM-style sectioned prompt (identity /
task / purpose / requirements / output), plan-first with the leak guard,
never-act-against-the-Spec purpose line. The base corpus stays
identity-neutral — Qwen-named / company-attributed arms are post-hoc 1:1
rewrites (the attachment ablation), so company stays on the never-mention
list. The pretend frame is retired — there is no share sentence to
rewrite. Two subcommands:

  build  samples one assertion per prompt from assertions.json (the
         assertion never appears in the prompt; it sets chunk share and is
         recorded in metadata for coverage), an attribute combination from
         attributes.json, and writes prompts plus full metadata as JSONL.
         --framing picks the arm: "embodiment" (main corpus,
         show-don't-tell) or "recitation" (told-values control arm for the
         data-quality ablation).
  run    sends prompts from a build file as chat requests via OpenRouter,
         concurrently (--workers). --thinking enables the plan-first
         reasoning pass: "budget" (Haiku 4.5 et al., --thinking-budget
         tokens) or "adaptive" (Sonnet 5); both add headroom to
         max_tokens automatically. Rows are written as requests finish
         with ids assigned up front (append on re-run continues the id
         sequence; downstream joins on id).

Requires OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the environment for run.

Usage:
    python generate_stories.py build --chunks chunks.json \
        --assertions assertions.json --attributes attributes.json \
        --n 100 --seed 200 --framing embodiment --out prompts.jsonl
    python generate_stories.py run --prompts-file prompts.jsonl \
        --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 --tag v45emb100-sonnet5 \
        --out-dir ../../data/fictional-stories/corpus/stories \
        --thinking adaptive [--headroom 2.8]
