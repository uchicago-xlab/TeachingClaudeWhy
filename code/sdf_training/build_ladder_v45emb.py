"""Build the v4.5 nano-embodiment scaling-ladder rung files (2026-09-14).

Five rungs, each a nested prefix of one ordered sequence of stories:

    3M   = the first stories of the trained 14M file, in its trained order
    14M  = the trained sdf-v45emb-nano54-14M.jsonl file, unchanged (this
           rung is already trained and evaluated; nothing is written for it)
    28M  = 14M + the new pool, shuffled once with a fixed seed, cut at 2x
    56M  = same sequence cut at 4x
    112M = same sequence cut at 8x

Rung targets are multiples of the 14M file's exact token count, and every
cut lands on a story boundary at the first row that reaches the target, so
each rung is data-identical to the start of the next. The 300-story test
set (v45emb-nano54-ladder-heldout.jsonl) was removed from the pool before
this script runs and is in no rung.

Each rung trains as a standalone 2-epoch run on the fsdp_fa3 lane, so the
rungs are separate files rather than one doubled-increment stream (the old
build_ladder_corpus.py design for the constant-LR LLaMA-Factory lane).

Token counts use the Qwen2.5-32B tokenizer, +1 eos per story, the same
convention as the postgen report. The manifest records rows, tokens and
the per-chunk share of every rung against the pool's share, so a topically
skewed prefix would show up before anything trains.
